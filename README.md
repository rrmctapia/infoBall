# What is this app?

Hi welcome to my github! My name is Ravi Tapia and I'm trying to get comfortable with new technologies such as React.JS. In order to this, I built a very simple app that allows you to get statistics and basic data on the active nba players! I chose the name info-ball because I feel very out of the loop when talking about NBA topics although I play basketball. So in order to dip my toe in React and NBA, I made this app! 

## How to run it
Step 1:  Clone this repository into a new directory using git
```bash
```
Step 2:
```bash
 npm install
```
Step 3 Replace comments in App.js with your own API key!
```bash
filler
```
Step 4
```bash
npm run start
```
